	"""Python implementation of Christofides approximation to the Traveling 
	Salesperson Problem. This function makes use of Vladimir Kolmogorov's
	C++ implementation of his Blossom V algorithm for finding a Minimum Cost
	Perfect Matching in a weighted graph. 

	Requirements: 	
		- Graph must be a complete graph (every node must be connected 
		to every other node). To randomly generate complete graphs, see
		random_graph.py module.
		- Graph is formated as a 0-indexed list of nodes and a list of 
		edges, where each edge is a tuple: (node1, node2, weight)

	UPDATES & TO-DO:
		- Will modify this function to more optimally interact with C++
		program.
